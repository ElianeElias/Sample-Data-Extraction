Patricia J. Rodriguez, et al. 2024	Baseline weight:
Tirzepatide: 110 (25.7) kg
Semaglutide: 109 (25.2) kg

(End point not measured)	3 months:
•	Tirzepatide: −5.9% (95% CI, −6.0% to −5.8%)
•	Semaglutide: −3.6% (95% CI, −3.7% to −3.4%)
6 months:
•	Tirzepatide: −10.1% (95% CI, −10.4% to −9.9%)
•	Semaglutide: −5.8% (95% CI, −6.0% to −5.5%)
At 12 months:
•	Tirzepatide: −15.3% (95% CI, −16.0% to −14.5%)
•	Semaglutide: −8.3% (95% CI, −9% to −7.6%)
	Tirzepatide: 81.8% (95% CI, 79.8%-83.7%
Semaglutide: 66.5% (95% CI, 64.3%-68.7%)	Tirzepatide: 62.1% (95% CI, 59.7%-64.3%)

Conclusion 
Patricia J. Rodriguez, et al. 2024	No significant differences in the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs) 	Not reported	Tirzepatide: 5140 [55.9%]; 
semaglutide: 4823 [52.5%]	Not reported 	In the population of adults with overweight or obesity, use of tirzepatide was associated with significantly greater weight loss than semaglutide.
